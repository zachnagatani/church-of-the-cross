person and work of Christ is the hermeneutical lens by which we interpret Scripture (Luke
24:44), and engage our culture. It is the message about who Jesus is and what he
accomplished through his atoning work of the cross.</p>
						<p class="lead goth">While all churches will affirm this at some level, we believe this isn’t merely something to
affirm, but rather the central purpose for the universal and local church community. The
good news of Jesus guides and directs our vision, our ministry, and our cultural engagement.</p>

means by which the Father sent his Son to die for the sins of the world. Jesus affirms that in
order to follow Jesus we are to bear the cross as well (Mark 8:34-38; Luke 14:27).</p>
						<p class="lead goth">Similarly, Paul shows us that just as Jesus bore the shame of the cross in his humanity as a
slave, likewise those who call Jesus Lord and King are to lives that reflect the cross (Phil.
2:5-11). We call this a living a cruciform life . A cruciform life is all about self-denial,
sacrifice, and the commitment to living and dying in the service of others. It is a life shaped
like and shaped by the cross of Christ..</p>

family. The metaphors for the church being “God’s children” or the “brothers and sisters of
Christ” are used with a purpose (Mark 3:34-35; Acts 2:42-47; Rom. 8:14-17). In an individualistic culture where the family structure has been redefined, and often times has
been destroyed, we believe God has established a better family, one which all who call upon
the name of Jesus as Lord is a part of and committed to.</p>

world. Jesus’ purpose for coming into earth was to begin the process of establishing God’s
kingdom. Since the culmination of God’s kingdom plan doesn’t occur until Jesus’ second
coming, the church is participating with God until that full completion. This is the mission of
God, and we as church are enthusiastic about this participation.</p>

worship where hear God speak through his word, and partake in his body and blood –
historically known as Communion, or the Lord’s Supper. In addition, we also meet weekly in
smaller communities known as community groups. These groups are designed to continue in
the encouragement and growth of the individual with in the larger church community. In
these groups we share a meal, continue in the study of God’s word and its significance in our
lives, as well as prayer for particular needs. We do not see these groups as an additional
program, but rather one necessary part of our corporate identity as a community. In other
words, it’s a lifestyle.</p>

	    				<p class="lead goth">Our desire is not to reproduce the individualism prevalent within
our culture, but rather to see holistic faith occur within the church, thus inviting people into a
vibrant community. We plan to accomplish this by participating in the following:</p>

						<ol class="goth font-16">
							<li><strong>HEAD (Intellectual)</strong> – Participate with other churches, and community events, that give a
platform to make the intellectual ideas of the Christian faith known to the broader culture.</li><br />
							<li><strong>HEART (Relational)</strong> – Evangelism and discipleship go hand in hand. Intellectual
discussions (HEAD) should hopefully give room for relational (HEART) interaction.</li><br />
							<li><strong>HANDS (Practical)</strong> – Sometimes the greatest thing we can do in order to make the saving
grace of Jesus known is to serve the practical needs of the community. While we desire
most of the practical needs to be met through the community groups, we will also
interact the local needs of our community accordingly.</li>
						</ol>
						<p class="lead goth" id="abt-distinctives">In addition, the process of making disciples should result in further gospel ministry. We
desire to see an impact of the gospel in local businesses, domestic church planting, and
global missions, as people feel called, and per individual growth. Our aim is to develop each
other into these specific works of ministry.</p>

	    			<div class="col-md-12">
	    				<p class="lead goth">We hold to the model of “elder” as opposed to “pastor” when it
comes to labeling church leadership and oversight. There are a few reasons for this; one
important reason is that this appears to be the term referenced for church leadership in the
New Testament (Acts 20:28; Phil. 1:1; Titus 1:7). We prefer to leave the title “pastor” or
“shepherd” to Jesus as our “Chief Shepherd” (1 Pet. 2:25)</p>
						<p class="lead goth">In addition, we believe that biblical and effective church leadership is done through a
plurality of elders, not a single CEO/Senior Pastor. This means that as we currently have only
one elder leading Church of the Cross, we have temporary co-eldership coming from our
sending church: Reunion Church. As we develop more elders within our church body, they
will replace the co-elders from Reunion Church.</p>

	    			<div class="col-md-12">
	    				<p class="lead goth">Most churches offer various Sunday and mid-week
ministries for youth of all ages. We hold to the view that true discipleship occurs within the
complete body of Christ, not by various sub-ministries or programs. We want to encourage
and cultivate an environment in which all members of the church, including our children and
young adults, can participate in the Sunday corporate worship experience. As a church we
have a high value for God’s Word being proclaimed, and the Lord’s Supper being partaken of
together as a family.</p>
						<p class="lead goth">However, we do desire for children in 5th grade and younger to experience and listen to God’s
Word, and the implications of the gospel, be taught in their own language. We also want to
leave open the option for all children of all ages to worship with their parents as well. We will
leave this to the discretion of the parents.</p>

	    				<p class="lead goth">We do affirm the continuation of all of what have been considered the
“supernatural” gifts (e.g. tongues, prophecy, healing, etc.). However, we believe these are
gifts that come from the Spirit (1 Cor. 12:1) for the purposes of edification for the church as
the Spirit sees fit to distribute (1 Cor. 12:12-14, 14:18-19), and for the furthering of the
gospel into all the world. During all formal and corporate gatherings any of these gifting’s are
to be done with order and discernment (1 Cor. 14:26-33).</p>
						<p class="lead goth" id="abt-sof">In order to maintain good order within the church, we will maintain a discerning posture
concerning the “testing” of all things deemed spiritual without “quenching” the movement of
the Spirit within our community (1 Thess. 5:19-22). Our mission will always be for the pursuit of following Christ and participating with him in his mission for San Diego.</p>
